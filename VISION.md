# The Vision of all this

These datapacks are meant to allow for the creation of an all-out-warfare pack,
but can allow for picking and choosing different aspects. For example, I could
decide to go strictly for exceptionally difficult vanilla-ish survival with
BearMetal Grinder, however it would be required if I wanted to use BearMetal
Medieval Warfare.

Through all of this exists a few more tweak-based packs. For example, BearMetal
Carts and BearMetal Recipes exist purely for buffing/retooling vanilla
functionality - like copper trapdoors costing 6 blocks. These packs generally
won't be used in the greater arena of packs

# Packs and their goals

## BearMetal Grinder

BearMetal Grinder is pretty straightforward. EVERYTHING is harder to get, and
the progression is significantly different from vanilla. This is one of the few
that actually requires a mod that allows for NBT tags in crafting recipes - I
will probably fork [this](https://modrinth.com/mod/nbt-crafting) to maintain it
myself

### Features

- Trying to do anything without a tool of some sort gives you mining fatigue
- There are sticks and stones around, a la Terrafirmacraft that allow you to
  make basic tools
- There are no wooden tools - they are retextured to be stone, and stone tools
  are retextured to copper tools
- Furnaces don't exist, partially to allow for custom blocks, but primarily to
  change refining
- Refining is a process
  - Raw Copper gives a normal copper ingot, however that needs to be crafted
    with more ingots to produce an "ingot stack" (not the real name), which is
    then smelted a second time with a mold for fuel to produce an item (tool
    head, armor piece)
  - Raw Iron gives an iron bloom, which needs to be heated and forged in a
    "forge" block
